# 100-days-of-coding-for-c

This is my own way of making myself accountable for the next 100 days of coding. I am a Full Stack Developer who loves building things from scratch. I currently work with PHP, JavaScript and Python. I would love to add the C programming language to my arsenal i try to transit into CyberSecurity.

This is my roadmap.
